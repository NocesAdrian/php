Some rules to follow for the HTML form:

Make sure that the form uses method="post"
The form also needs the following attribute: enctype="multipart/form-data". 
It specifies which content-type to use when submitting the form
Without the requirements above, the file upload will not work.

Other things to notice:

The type="file" attribute of the <input> tag shows the input field as a file-select control, with a "Browse" button next to the input control
The form above sends data to a file called "upload.php", which we will create next.
