PHP Overwriting
Now that "newfile.txt" contains some data we can show what happens when we open an existing file for writing. 
All the existing data will be ERASED and we start with an empty file.

In the example below we open our existing file "newfile.txt", and write some new data into it:

Example
<?php
$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
$txt = "Mickey Mouse\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
$txt = "Minnie Mouse\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
fclose($myfile);
?>

If we now open the "newfile.txt" file, both John and Jane have vanished, 
and only the data we just wrote is present:

Mickey Mouse
Minnie Mouse

PHP Append Text
You can append data to a file by using the "a" mode. The "a" mode appends text to the end of the file, while the "w" mode overrides (and erases) the old content of the file.

In the example below we open our existing file "newfile.txt", and append some text to it:

Example
<?php
$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "a") or die("Unable to open file!");
$txt = "Donald Duck\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
$txt = "Goofy Goof\n";
fwrite($myfile, $txt);
fclose($myfile);
?>
