Get PHP Session Variable Values
Next, we create another page called "demo_session2.php". From this page, 
we will access the session information we set on the first page ("demo_session1.php").

Notice that session variables are not passed individually to each new page, 
// cant access variable when session_start() is not declared

instead they are retrieved from the session we open at the beginning of each page (session_start()). 
// variables will be accessed when session_start is declared at the beginning before html tags

Also notice that all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable:

// this access the variables that are saved on $_SESSION[] global variable array


<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// Echo session variables that were set on previous page
echo "Favorite color is " . $_SESSION["favcolor"] . ".<br>";
echo "Favorite animal is " . $_SESSION["favanimal"] . ".";
?>

</body>
</html>


// Another way to show all the session variable values for a user session is to run the following code:
// print_r($_SESSION);

Example
<?php
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
print_r($_SESSION);
?>

</body>
</html>
