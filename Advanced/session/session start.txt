What is a PHP Session?

KEY TERM: saves preference of the user from when he opened a browser until he closed the browser
session saves users preference in one session means if he closed the browser the users preference will be forgotten 

When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, 
and then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. 
It knows when you start the application and when you end. But on the internet there is one problem: 
the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.

Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages 
(e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.

So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.

Tip: If you need a permanent storage, you may want to store the data in a database.

Start a PHP Session
A session is started with the session_start() function.

Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.

// this start a session()
// start to save user preferences until browser is closed

Note: The session_start() function must be the very first thing in your document. Before any HTML tags.

<?php
// Start the session
session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// Set session variables
$_SESSION["favcolor"] = "green";
$_SESSION["favanimal"] = "cat";
echo "Session variables are set.";
?>

</body>
</html>
