What is an Exception?
An exception is an object that describes an error or unexpected behaviour of a PHP script.

Exceptions are thrown by many PHP functions and classes.

User defined functions and classes can also throw exceptions.

Exceptions are a good way to stop a function when it comes across data that it cannot use.

Throwing an Exception
The throw statement allows a user defined function or method to throw an exception. 
When an exception is thrown, the code following it will not be executed.

If an exception is not caught, a fatal error will occur with an "Uncaught Exception" message.


The try...catch Statement
To avoid the error from the example above, we can use the try...catch statement to catch exceptions and continue the process.

Syntax
try {
  code that can throw exceptions
} catch(Exception $e) {
  code that runs when an exception is caught
}

The catch block indicates what type of exception should be caught and the name of the variable which can be used to 
access the exception. In the example above, the type of exception is Exception and the variable name is $e.
