The PHP Date() Function
The PHP date() function formats a timestamp to a more readable date and time.

Syntax
date(format,timestamp)
Parameter	Description
format	Required. Specifies the format of the timestamp
timestamp	Optional. Specifies a timestamp. Default is the current date and time

A timestamp is a sequence of characters, denoting the date and/or time at which a certain event occurred.


Get a Date
The required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).

Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:

d - Represents the day of the month (01 to 31)
m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week
Other characters, like"/", ".", or "-" can also be inserted between the characters to add additional formatting.

<?php
echo "Today is " . date("Y/m/d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("Y.m.d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("Y-m-d") . "<br>";
echo "Today is " . date("l");
?>

PHP Tip - Automatic Copyright Year

Example
&copy; 2010-<?php echo date("Y");?>
