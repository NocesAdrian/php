PHP - What are Abstract Classes and Methods?
Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.

An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method is a 
method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.

-> abstract methods and properties are designed to force all subclasses that extend the abstract class to implement them 
(or define them). When you define an abstract method or abstract property in an abstract class, 
it ensures that every subclass must provide its own implementation for those methods or properties.

An abstract class or method is defined with the abstract keyword:

<?php
abstract class ParentClass {
  abstract public function someMethod1();
  abstract public function someMethod2($name, $color);
  abstract public function someMethod3() : string;
}
?>

purpose is to force subclass to make this method or property
