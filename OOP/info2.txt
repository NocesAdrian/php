A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.

class are materials to create an object

OOP Case
Let's assume we have a class named Fruit. A Fruit can have properties like name, color, weight, etc. 
We can define variables like $name, $color, and $weight to hold the values of these properties.

When the individual objects (apple, banana, etc.) are created, they inherit all 
the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.

Define a Class
A class is defined by using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class 
and a pair of curly braces ({}). All its properties and methods go inside the braces:

Syntax

<?php
class Fruit {
  // code goes here...
}
?>
