PHP - The __destruct Function
A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

If you create a __destruct() function, PHP will automatically call this function at the end of the script.

Notice that the destruct function starts with two underscores (__)!

the __destruct() method in PHP cannot have arguments. It is automatically called when an object is destroyed, and 
since it is part of the object lifecycle, PHP does not allow you to pass any arguments to the destructor.

The example below has a __construct() function that is automatically called when you create an object 
from a class, and a __destruct() function that is automatically called at the end of the script:

ExampleGet your own PHP Server
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  function __destruct() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}.";
  }
}

$apple = new Fruit("Apple");
?>

// OUTPUT: The fruit is Apple


// basically destruct will get executed when the script running is stop or done

// destruct will always get executed at the end...
