PHP Namespaces
Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:

looks like file tree better organize things 
treat namespace like a folder for files(class)

They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
They allow the same name to be used for more than one class

Note: A namespace declaration must be the first thing in the PHP file. The following code would be invalid:

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
namespace Html;
...
?>

For example, you may have a set of classes which describe an HTML table, 
such as Table, Row and Cell while also having another set of classes to describe furniture, 
such as Table, Chair and Bed. Namespaces can be used to organize the classes into two different 
groups while also // preventing the two classes Table and Table from being mixed up.

Declaring a Namespace
Namespaces are declared at the beginning of a file using the namespace keyword:

Syntax
Declare a namespace called Html:

<?php
namespace Html;
?>
