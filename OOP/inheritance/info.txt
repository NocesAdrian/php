PHP - What is Inheritance?
Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods 
from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

Let's look at an example:

<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

// Strawberry is inherited from Fruit
class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public function message() {
    echo "Am I a fruit or a berry? ";
  }
}
$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red"); // __construct function of the parent class Fruit is used
$strawberry->message();
$strawberry->intro(); // intro function of parent class Fruit is used
?>

Example Explained
The Strawberry class is inherited from the Fruit class.

This means that the Strawberry class can use the public $name and $color properties 
as well as the public __construct() and intro() methods from the Fruit class because of inheritance.

The Strawberry class also has its own method: message().
