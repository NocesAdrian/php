What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

$exp = "/w3schools/i";
In the example above, / is the delimiter, w3schools is the pattern that is being searched for, and i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.

The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The most common delimiter is the forward slash (/),
but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.

preg_match()	Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not
preg_match_all()	Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the string, which may also be 0
preg_replace()	Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with another string

Modifiers can change how a search is performed.
i	Performs a case-insensitive search	
m	Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for a match at the beginning or end of a string will now match the beginning or end of each line)	
u	Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns
